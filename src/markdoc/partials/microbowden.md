Push the bowden tube through the opening on the top or bottom, try not to make irreversible kinks while pushing.
A small flathead or any tool you can fit in the opening of the front may be used to help move the
bowden along the path. You will need to complete this step a couple of times to get the correct
measurements/length for your hotend. The easiest way to do this is secure the extruder to the block
push the bowden up through the bottom till it bottoms out. Then take a guess at the length needed
for your hotend, overestimate it by quite a bit. Now start cutting away until you get a flush fit.

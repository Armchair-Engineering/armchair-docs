### Video Guide
Soonâ„¢

### Step by Step
Your belts should be routed through your gantry at this point, now we're going to install the belt clips.

- Pull your belt through the belt clips.
- Make a loop and pinch together so that the teeth are locking together.
- Pull the belt back through the same hole in the clip.
- Leave enough slack in the previous step, and slide the 4mm OD tubes through the opening of the loop and through the centre of the clip.

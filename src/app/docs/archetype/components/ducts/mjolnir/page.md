### Assembly

#### Heatsets
Install the heatsets into the blower fans.

#### Install the fans
Hold the blowers in position, and secure to the duct with 2x M3x16 BHCS.

FHCS are used to secure the fans on the outer part of the ducts for Y rail clearance.

BHCS secure the inner part of the blower to the duct.

#### Secure the ducts
Push the ducts against the rest of the assembly.

The M3x35mm SHCS go into the top holes, and secure into the square nuts you installed earlier on the extruder block.
M3x20mm SHCS will go in the bottom two holes, securing to the heatsets.

Mjölnir's ducts have a press-fit tab, that will insert into the probe spacer.

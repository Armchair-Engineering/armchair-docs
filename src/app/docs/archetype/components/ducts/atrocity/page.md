#### Secure the ducts
Push the ducts against the rest of the assembly.

The M3x35mm SHCS go into the top holes, and secure into the square nuts you installed earlier on the extruder block.
M3x20mm SHCS will go in the bottom two holes, securing to the heatsets.

Atrocity ducts have a press-fit tab, that will insert into the probe spacer.

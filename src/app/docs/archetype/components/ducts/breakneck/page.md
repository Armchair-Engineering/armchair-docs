The M3x35mm SHCS go into the top holes, and secure into the square nuts you installed earlier on the extruder block.
M3x20mm SHCS will go in the bottom two holes, securing to the heatsets

#### CPAP Hose & Removable Head
It is easier to install the hose to the removable head beforehand, then slide the head onto the body.
There is a small flange on the inlet of the head to keep the hose more secure, you may find
a screwing motion helps get the hose on the inlet easier.
